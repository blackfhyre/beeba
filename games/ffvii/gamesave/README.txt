Hello Buyer,

The description clearly states that this is not a phyisical copy of the original game, but a file with multiple gamesave files that may be accessed with the proper physical or downloaded Final Fantasy VII game.  It is stated several times in the item description that this is not the physical game to play, nut a gamesave file accesiable only with the game in hand.  It is also stated that there are no refunds, as the item is clearly described in the description.  I am sorry for your inconvenience, but please read the entire description of the auction before you purchase.
